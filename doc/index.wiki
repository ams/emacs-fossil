<title>Emacs Integration for Fossil</title>

This mini-project is for integrating emacs into fossil.  This needs a
few changes into fossil and needs a new file to be loaded into emacs.

You need emacs version 23.1 or better.  This definitely does not work
with versions 22.*.

<h4>How Do I load Fossil support into emacs?</h4>

Short answer:

Add this to your .emacs file, or cut and paste this into *scratch* buffer and do
<code>C-x e</code> to execute it.   

<pre>
(setq vc-handled-backends '(CVS Fossil))
(load-file "/path/to/this/project/vc/el/vc-fossil.el")
</pre>

<h4>What changes to fossil are required</h4>

There are a few changes required to 3 files (src/file.c, src/finfo.c
and src/update.c) in the fossil tree.  These are currently in the
fossil repository in the "venks-emacs" branch.  In the fossil source
checkout do this:

<pre>
% fossil update venks-emacs
% make
</pre>
  
That builds you a fossil executable which can be used by this
emacs elisp package

<h4>What emacs keys do I need?</h4>

This integrates fossil into emacs vc builtin mode.  The same keys will
work for fossil inside a fossil tree as for other scms outside.

A few are:

<table>
<tr><td><code>C-x v d</code></td><td>Run Fossil dired - like cvs-examine</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>C-x v l</code></td><td>When in a file, show log</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>v</code></td><td>In VC, do next action: merge/update/checkin</td></tr>
</table>

</table>
